# ‚úîÔ∏è Project Management System üìî

## [See Live web](https://project-task.herokuapp.com/)

# Introduction

Welcome to my Fourth Full Stack Course project. This is a Project Management System.

The inspiration for this project was my side learning process of becoming a certified SCRUM master, as well as observation of project managers from my company using multiple trackers, which seemed impractical. As a SCRUM Master, one of the most needed items is to have a tool to collect and monitor workload, progress, and deadlines. The tool itself can be used in any project management world. In the current world, where Covid changed the way of doing the business and most of the things are done online, having a simple yet sufficient tool to track the progress of your team, project members and other function are essential to bringing efficiency to the company. 

The goal was to create a tool, which in the future can be adjusted according to the specific customer needs.

# **1. UX**

As the next step on my path of becoming a software developer from zero to hero üòä, I'm presenting a Project Manager Tool. As mentioned in my last projects my ultimate goal is to change my career path and become a full-time developer. Here I will be showing my newly acquired skills, which are Django and DataBase. As part of my portfolio collection, which can be shown to my potential future employers, and potentially to be used by myself. I have decided to build a product that can support the day to day workload of Project Managers or SCRUM masters. The product is simple to use and intuitive, the navigation around the page is clear and gives users the ability to search and filter through things like date or status. The product can be adjusted in the future for specific customer needs, as well as certain features can be added if the business needs them. The current tool includes elements such as project name, task, due date, and owner. The tool can hold multiple projects, meaning the project manager or SCRUM master can have an overview of all actions open against each project they are working on. Having all in one space optimizes time and effort for task management.

# **1.1 Strategy**

#  **1.1.1 Project Goals**

A project goal was to create a set PM tool belt where project tasks can be monitored, this page has the potential to build more tools in upcoming project #5, where additional features like Gantt Chart, Critical Path, Delay Calculator, and Task Time Calculator could be added. Currently, the tool has abilities to store tasks against multiple projects, owners, and due dates. Users can select either a specific project or choose the owner of the task.
 
The reason for this web page is to create a tool that I can use as a potential PM SCRUM master in the future also to create a product that can be sellable. Therefore, in my thought process, I aimed to create a good basis in project #4 and expand on that in the future

# **5. Development Cycle**


Page was built based on diagrams, user stories, and wireframes. In the first days of this project, I was focused on installing packets and building the connection with a database & Cloudinary. Once I built the connection with the database I did deploy the project to Heroku to avoid potential errors with the deployed version.
 
CRUD functionality over task list was the next phase of this implementation, to ensure the user is capable of manipulating data by adding, updating, deleting, and marking as completed to have full control over the information.
 
Adding Automatic test for CRUD functionality.
 
Adding Calendar picker to due date field to avoid potential issues with typing date in the different way as is expected by form, as well as improve UX by delivering visual ability to locate the chosen date on the calendar itself.
 
As per the Agile approach, the next feature appearing during the next iteration cycle was an issue with building a separate way to store Projects in the form of the list. This enabled users to have the ability to standardize project naming conventions and keep control over the data and future task creation.
 
To ensure the project data has CRUD functionality, I decided to build it in the class view model, which gave me an opportunity to learn this approach in a real situation.
 
The filter option was implemented to reduce displayed data and to give a better end user experience. To avoid an overwhelming number of displayed data the pagination was implemented.
 
Final bug fix run, where issues like registration error, query set conflicts were addressed.
 
The last stage of the process was styling the page in CSS and creating a ReadMe file.
