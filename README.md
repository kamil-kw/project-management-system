# ‚úîÔ∏è Project Management System üìî

## [See Live web](https://project-task.herokuapp.com/)

# Introduction

Welcome to my Fourth Full Stack Course project. This is a Project Management System.

The inspiration for this project was my site learning process of becoming a certified SCRUM master. As a SCRUM Master, one of the most needed items is to have an area to collect and monitor workload, progress, roadblocks.

Project is built with concept of being a product like tool capable to adjust according to the customer needs.

# **1. UX**

As a next step on my path of becoming a software developer from zero to hero üòä, I'm presenting a Project Manager Tool.
As mentioned in my last projects my ultimate goal is to change my career path and become a full-time developer. Here I will be showing my new acquired skill, which is Django.
As part of my portfolio collection, which can be shown to my potential future employers, and potentially be used by myself. I have decided to build a product that can support day to day workload of Project Managers or SCRUM masters. As a first part of this will be creating project task manager, where all projects can be collected and monitored during each project.

##  **1.1.1 Project Goals**

A project goal was to create a to set PM tool belt were project task can be monitored, this page have a potential to build more tools in upcoming project 5 were additional features like Gantt Chart, Critical Path, Delay Calculator, and Task Time Calculator will be added.

The reason for this web page is to create tool which I can use as a potential PM SCRUM master in the future also to create product which can be a sellable.

# **5. Development Cycle**

Page was building based on diagram and user stories. The first days of this project I was focused with installing packets and building the connection with a database & cloudinary. Once build the connection with database I did deploy project to Heroku to avoid potential error with deployed version.

CRUD functionality over task list was a next phase of this implementations, to ensure user is capable to manipulate data by adding, updating, deleting and marking as completed to have a full control over a data.

Adding Calendar picker to due date field to avoid potential issues with typing date in the different way as is expected by form as well as improve UX by delivering visual ability to locate chosen date on the calendar it self.

As per Agile approach the next features appear during next iteration cycle where an issue with building a separate way to store Projects in form of the list to have ability to standardize projects naming convention and keep control over a data and future task creation.
Tu ensure the project data is also coming under a CRUD functionality I decided to build it in the class view model, which give me an opportunity to learn this approach in real situation.

Filter option was implemented to reduce a displayed data and to give a better end user experience.
To avoid overwhelming number of displayed data the pagination was implemented.

# **6. Deployment**

To deploy my final project to the cloud I used Heroku. To do this I had to:

1. Push the latest code to GitHub.
2. Go to Heroku
3. Select new in the top right corner.
4. Create new app.
5. Enter the app name and select Europe as the region.
6. Connect to GitHub.
7. Search for repo-name.
8. Select connect to the relevant repo you want to deploy.
9. Select the settings tab.
10. Add buildpack
11. Select Python, then save changes.
12. Select Nodejs, then save changes.
13. Make sure Heroku/Python is at the top of the list, followed by Heroku/Nodejs
14. Navigate to the deploy tab
15. Scroll down to Manual Deploy and select deploy branch.
